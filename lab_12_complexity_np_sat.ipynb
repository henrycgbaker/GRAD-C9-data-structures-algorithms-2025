This is done through something called **reduction**: if we have two problems X and Y, we can say that X is at least as hard as Y if a known way to solve X would mean that we could also solve Y.\n\nMore formally: Problem X polynomial-time reduces to problem Y if instances of problem X can be solved using:\n* Polynomial number of standard computational steps, plus\n* Polynomial number of calls to a blackbox that solves problem Y in constant time.\n\nThe following mean the same thing:\n* X is polynomial-time reducible to Y\n* $X \\leq_P Y$\n* Y is at least as hard as X wrt polynomial time\n\nConclusions that can be made if $X \\leq_P Y$\n* and Y can be solved in polynomial time -> then X can be solved in polynomial time.\n* and X cannot be solved in polynomial time -> then Y cannot be solved in polynomial time.\n* and $Y \\leq_P X$ -> X can be solved in polynomial time if and only if Y can be\n\nEven if we don't know how to solve X or Y efficiently: if there is an efficient algorithm for one, there also is one for the other one (helps us when we design algorithms)!\n\n**Techniques for reduction:**\n\n**1. showing that two problems are equivalent**\n\nConsider the independent set problem (does a graph contain an independent set of nodes - set with no edges between any of them - of size at least k): no known polynomial-time algorithm, but also no proof that none exists! And consider another hard problem, the vertex cover problem (does a graph contain a vertex cover - set of nodes so that all edges have one end in the set - of size at most k). It can be shown that they are **equivalent**, by showing that solving each of them automatically solves the other.\n\n**2. showing that one problem is a special case for another one**\n\nSimilarly, it can be shown that the vertex cover problem is a **special case** of something more general called set cover problem (does there exist a collection of at most k subsets whose union is equal to all elements in the entire set)\n\n**3. encoding one problem so that it can be related (reduced) to another problem (see below)**"

   "source": "<details>\n<summary><b>Comprehension Check:</b> If we know that Problem A reduces to Problem B ($A \\leq_P B$), and we discover a polynomial-time algorithm for A, what can we conclude about B?</summary>\n\n**Answer:** Nothing! The reduction $A \\leq_P B$ tells us that B is *at least as hard* as A. If we solve A efficiently, we learn nothing about B. However, if we solve B efficiently, then A can also be solved efficiently (by using B as a subroutine).\n\n**Key insight:** Reductions preserve hardness in one direction only. Think of it as: \"If I can solve the hard problem B, I can definitely solve the easier problem A.\"\n</details>",

   "source": "## Satisfiability <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"satisfy\"></a>\n\nOne way to derive a **reduction** (point 3. in the list above) is by using the concept of satisfiability. The idea is to translate/encode the components of a problem X so that they represent the elements in another problem Y. The **satisfiability problem (SAT)** is fundamental to computational complexity theory.\n\n### Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF)\n\nA Boolean formula is in **Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF)** if it is a conjunction (AND) of clauses, where each clause is a disjunction (OR) of literals:\n\n$$(\\ell_{1,1} \\lor \\ell_{1,2} \\lor \\ldots) \\land (\\ell_{2,1} \\lor \\ell_{2,2} \\lor \\ldots) \\land \\ldots$$\n\nWhere each literal $\\ell$ is either a variable $x_i$ or its negation $\\neg x_i$.\n\n**Example:** $(x_1 \\lor \\neg x_2) \\land (\\neg x_1 \\lor \\neg x_3) \\land (x_2 \\lor \\neg x_3)$\n\n### The SAT Problem\n\nGiven a Boolean formula in CNF, the **satisfiability problem (SAT)** asks: does there exist an assignment of truth values to variables that makes the formula true?\n\n- **3-SAT**: SAT where each clause has exactly 3 literals (NP-complete)\n- **2-SAT**: SAT where each clause has exactly 2 literals (in P - polynomial time solvable!)\n\n<details>\n<summary><b>Comprehension Check:</b> Why is 2-SAT in P but 3-SAT is NP-complete?</summary>\n\n**Answer:** The key difference is that 2-SAT clauses $(a \\lor b)$ can be rewritten as implications: $\\neg a \\Rightarrow b$ and $\\neg b \\Rightarrow a$. This creates an **implication graph** where we can use strongly connected components (SCC) to detect contradictions in $O(n + m)$ time.\n\nWith 3 literals per clause, this implication structure breaks down — we can't reduce $(a \\lor b \\lor c)$ to simple implications. The extra literal creates exponentially more possibilities to check.\n</details>\n\n### Example: Meeting Scheduling\n\nSuppose we want to schedule a meeting:\n- Elisa can meet Monday, Wednesday, or Thursday: $(Mon \\lor Wed \\lor Thu)$\n- Juan cannot meet Wednesday: $(\\neg Wed)$\n- Ali cannot meet Friday: $(\\neg Fri)$\n- Kim cannot meet Tuesday or Thursday: $(\\neg Tue) \\land (\\neg Thu)$\n\nThe CNF formula is: $(Mon \\lor Wed \\lor Thu) \\land (\\neg Wed) \\land (\\neg Fri) \\land (\\neg Tue) \\land (\\neg Thu)$\n\n**Satisfying assignment:** $Mon = True$, all others $False$ → Monday works!\n\n### Cook-Levin Theorem\n\nA foundational result in complexity theory:\n\n> **SAT is NP-complete** (Cook 1971, Levin 1973)\n\nThis means:\n1. SAT is in NP (we can verify a solution in polynomial time)\n2. Every problem in NP can be reduced to SAT in polynomial time\n\n**Why is this remarkable?** The theorem says that ANY computational problem where solutions can be verified quickly can be encoded as a SAT instance. This includes:\n- Program verification: \"Does this program halt within k steps?\"\n- Constraint satisfaction: \"Can these constraints be satisfied?\"\n- Optimisation: \"Is there a solution with value ≥ k?\"\n\n**Proof sketch:** Any NP problem has a polynomial-time verifier. We can encode:\n- The verifier's computation as a Boolean circuit\n- The circuit's correctness constraints as CNF clauses\n- A satisfying assignment corresponds to a valid certificate\n\n**Consequence:** If anyone finds a polynomial-time algorithm for SAT, then P = NP.\n\n### The 3-SAT to Independent Set Reduction\n\nOne of the most elegant reductions shows **3-SAT $\\leq_P$ Independent Set**. Here's how it works:\n\n**Construction:** Given a 3-SAT formula with $k$ clauses:\n\n1. **Create clause gadgets:** For each clause $(a \\lor b \\lor c)$, create 3 nodes (one per literal) connected in a triangle.\n\n2. **Add conflict edges:** Connect nodes for contradictory literals ($x_i$ and $\\neg x_i$) across different triangles.\n\n**Example:** For formula $(x_1 \\lor \\neg x_2 \\lor x_3) \\land (\\neg x_1 \\lor x_2 \\lor x_3)$:\n\n```\nClause 1 triangle:        Clause 2 triangle:\n    x₁                        ¬x₁\n   /  \\                      /   \\\n ¬x₂---x₃                  x₂----x₃\n\nConflict edges (dashed): x₁----¬x₁, ¬x₂----x₂\n```\n\n**Why it works:**\n- Triangle edges force us to pick **at most one** node per clause\n- To get an independent set of size $k$, we need **exactly one** from each clause\n- Conflict edges prevent picking both $x_i$ and $\\neg x_i$\n- Therefore: independent set of size $k$ ↔ satisfying assignment"

   "source": "## P, NP, NP-complete, EXP <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"problems\"></a>\n\nThe way in which we distinguish between these types of problems is based on the difference between **finding** a solution and **checking** a given solution. (For example: for the Independent Set or 3-SAT problems, we do not know a polynomial-time algorithm to find solutions but we can check a proposed solution in polynomial time.)\n\n### P (Polynomial Time) — EASY TO SOLVE\n\nDecision problems with a polynomial-time **algorithm**. These are problems we can solve efficiently.\n\n**Examples:** Sorting, shortest path, 2-SAT, primality testing\n\n### NP (Nondeterministic Polynomial Time) — EASY TO CHECK\n\nDecision problems with a polynomial-time **certifier** (a checking algorithm that, given a 'certificate' or proof, can verify if a solution is correct). \n\nThe name \"NP\" comes from **N**ondeterministic **P**olynomial time — imagine a machine that can magically guess the right certificate, then verify it in polynomial time.\n\n**Key insight:** $P \\subseteq NP$ — if we can solve a problem in polynomial time, we can certainly verify a solution in polynomial time (just solve it again).\n\n**The P vs NP Question:** Is there a problem in NP that is NOT in P? This is one of the most important open problems in computer science and mathematics. Most experts believe **P ≠ NP** (that some NP problems cannot be solved efficiently), but no one has proven this.
